## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Microservices?

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system before proceeding:

- **Git** - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Visual Studio 2022** (with .NET Core Workloads) - [Download Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- **Docker Desktop** - [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Clone the Repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/smartdusttechnologies/Trainings.git
cd Muskan/Microservices
```

## Change the Connection String of All Microservices

### **For Basket Service**
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {      
  "SqlServerDb": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=BasketDb;User Id=YOUR_ID;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;TrustServerCertificate=True",
  "Redis": "localhost:6379"
}
```

### **For Catalog Service**
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "SqlServerDb": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=CatalogDb;User Id=YOUR_ID;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;TrustServerCertificate=True"   
}
```

### **For Order Service**
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {  
  "SqlServerDb": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=OrderDb;User Id=YOUR_ID;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;TrustServerCertificate=True"
}
```

---


### **For Basket Service**
```sh
Add-Migration Initial -StartupProject Basket.API 
```

### **For Catalog Service**
```sh
Add-Migration Initial -StartupProject Catalog.API 
```

### **For Order Service**
```sh
Add-Migration Initial -StartupProject Ordering.API -Project Ordering.Infrastructure -OutDir Data/Migrations 
```

---

### Run Docker Containers:
Ensure Docker Desktop is running, then execute the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
This will start all microservices in detached mode.
 ---

### Run the Shopping Web App

## Or 

### Using Visual Studio
1. Open **Visual Studio 2022**.
2. Load the `Muskan/Microservices` solution.
3. Set **Multiple Startup Projects**.
4. Select **docker-compose** and **Shopping.Web**.
5. Run the project (`F5` or `Ctrl + F5`).

---

### Access API Gateway:
Once the application is running, you can access the API Gateway at:
```
http://localhost:5005/
