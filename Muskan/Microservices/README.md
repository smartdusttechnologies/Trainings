# Microservices Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This project follows a **Microservices Architecture**, where each service is independently developed, deployed, and managed. Below is a detailed explanation of each microservice, its responsibilities, technologies used, and API endpoints.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core  
- **Frontend:** ASP.NET Core Razor Page  
- **Database:** SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Redis  
- **Pattern and Principles:**  
  - **Architecture:** Vertical Slice Architecture, Clean Architecture  
  - **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ  
  - **Containerization:** Docker  
  - **API Gateway:** YARP
