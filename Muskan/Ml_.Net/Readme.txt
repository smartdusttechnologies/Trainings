üìñ Project Overview
This project integrates an ASP.NET Core MVC application with a Python Flask API to predict job titles from resumes uploaded in PDF format. The ASP.NET Core application sends input data to a Flask server running a machine learning model, receives predictions, and displays the results seamlessly to the user.


## üîç Key Features

- **ASP.NET Core MVC Integration** 

- **HTTP POST Requests**    

- **JSON Serialization & Deserialization**    

- **User Interaction**  
  
Pair of Projects :

Python(endpoint)                                                    Asp.net 

Endpoint(For Ml multiple pdf upload)                                Ml_Models_In_Vs
Deep_Learning_Resume_Endpoint(For DL multiple pdf upload)           Ml_Models_In_Vs

‚ö° Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/smartdusttechnologies/Trainings.git

   
   üìò For ASP.NET Core Application
   Install .NET SDK:
   Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your system. Download it from the official site:
   üëâ Download .NET SDK ( https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
 The version .net is 6.0 
   Open the Project:
   Open your project in either Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

   Restore NuGet Packages:
   Navigate to the project root folder and run:
   --> dotnet restore
   Configure Flask Service:
   Before running your ASP.NET project, ensure that the Flask server is running on:
   üåê http://127.0.0.1:5000
 
 3. For Python(Endpoint)
 This project requires Python 3.10.6. If you have a different version, you can download the required version from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3106/ 
  A. Make virtual environment 
 # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv  
    If you encounter version issues, use:
    py -3.10 -m venv venv  (Make sure you already install python3.10.6)


 # Activate the virtual environment
    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
 B. Install the required packages: 

   pip install -r requirements.txt 
If you are using python3.10.6
   py -3.10 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

 To run the machine learning model
py -3.10 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm  

   

üìö Usage
‚úÖ 1. Start the Flask Server
   python main.py 
‚úÖ 2. Run the ASP.NET Core Project
   dotnet run
‚úÖ 3. After this in Resume page you can upload the resume and find the job recommendations.


Train the Model 
1. Install Jupyter Notebook:
To train or re-train the model, you can use Jupyter Notebook. First, install it:

pip install notebook

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
Open the terminal/command prompt and run the command to start the notebook:
jupyter notebook

3. Setup Environment for Model Training:
Install additional dependencies for the training environment:
!pip install pandas numpy nltk tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn PyPDF2 joblib gensim
 
4. Open the Notebook:
Open the Deep Learning Resume Matcher.ipynb or Resume Matcher.ipynb file in Jupyter to start model training.
