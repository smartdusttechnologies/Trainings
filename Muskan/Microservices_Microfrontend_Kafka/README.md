## Microservices Communication

| Service          | Communication   | Technology       |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Product Service  | REST API        | HTTP             |
| Order Service    | Event-Driven    | RabbitMQ         |
| Basket Service   | REST API + gRPC | HTTP + gRPC      |
| Discount Service | Grpc            | Protocol Buffers |

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Microservices?

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system before proceeding:

- **Git** - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Visual Studio 2022** (with .NET Core Workloads) - [Download Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- **Docker Desktop** - [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **SQL Server** (if using SQL-based databases) - [Download SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
- **SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)** - [Download SSMS](https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup)

---

### Clone the Repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/smartdusttechnologies/Trainings.git
cd Muskan/Microservices2
```

### Change the Connection String of All Microservices

#### **For Basket Service**

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
"SqlServerDb": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=BasketDb;User Id=YOUR_ID;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;TrustServerCertificate=True",
"Redis": "localhost:6379"
}
```

#### **For Catalog Service**

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "SqlServerDb": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=CatalogDb;User Id=YOUR_ID;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;TrustServerCertificate=True"
}
```

#### **For Order Service**

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "SqlServerDb": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=OrderDb;User Id=YOUR_ID;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;TrustServerCertificate=True"
}
```

#### **For Logging Service**

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "SqlServerDb": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=OrderDb;User Id=YOUR_ID;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;TrustServerCertificate=True"
}
```

---

### Database Migration (If Necessary)

Note:_ Migration is already run. Simply running the app will automatically update the database by checking if it exists. However, if needed, run the following commands:_

#### **For Basket Service**

Navigate to each services

```sh
cd Microservices2/Basket/src
```

```sh
Add-Migration Initial -StartupProject Basket.API
```

#### **For Catalog Service**

```sh
cd Microservices2/Product/src
```

```sh
Add-Migration Initial -StartupProject Catalog.API
```

#### **For Order Service**

```sh
cd Microservices2/Order/src
```

```sh
Add-Migration Initial -StartupProject Ordering.API -Project Ordering.Infrastructure -OutDir Data/Migrations
```

```sh
cd Microservices2/Logging/src/Logging.API
```

```sh
Add-Migration Initial -StartupProject Logging.API
```

---

### Running the Microservices

#### Run Docker Containers for the First Time (Visual Studio)

- Open Visual Studio.

- In the Startup Project dropdown, select Docker-compose.

- Run the application.

- Check it locally in Visual Studio.

#### Run Docker Containers:

Ensure Docker Desktop is running, then execute the following command:

Go to each Microservices Solution folder for each

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

In root project Microservices2
there is common images of database, messagebroker etc .,

```sh
docker-compose docker-compose.common.yml up -d
```

Alternative
Locate DockerComposeBat.bat.

Double-click to execute the script.

---

#### Access API Gateway:

Once the application is running, you can access the API Gateway at:

```
https://localhost:6065/
```

# MicroFrontend

## Overview

### MicroFrontend Architecture

![Overview](./Overview/Microfrontend.png)

## Introduction

- This project is part of a microfrontend architecture designed to create a modular and scalable web application. The microfrontends involved in this project include **Auth**, **Dashboard**, **Container**, and **Marketing (Landing Page)**, each responsible for distinct features of the application. The goal is to provide a seamless user experience by integrating these microfrontends into a host application using Webpack Module Federation.

- **Auth Microfrontend**: Handles user authentication, including login and registration.
- **Dashboard Microfrontend**: Displays the dashboard
- **Container Microfrontend**: Serves as the host application that loads and integrates the other microfrontends.
- **Marketing (Landing Page) Microfrontend**: Provides the marketing landing page for the application
- **Product Microfrontend**: Display product list and details
- **Basket Microfrontend**: Display product list and details Display basket or cart and checkout the order
- **Order Microfrontend**: Display the list of Order with the customer Id

## Steps to Install
